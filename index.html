      <section>In a small country in Central Asia called Kyrgyzstan, the LGBT+ community is daily plagued with stigmatization and discrimination.</span> They face limited access to social services, abuse from police, illegal detentions, blackmailing, domestic violence, physical attacks, rape and even torture. They lack safe environments where they can meet, socialize, talk or just simply be themselves.</section>
<section>Recent constitutional amendments, passed via a referendum, have strengthened the power of the state at both the cost of democracy and civic society. The state campaign advocating for the amendments was full of anti-LGBT messages, with particular focus on changing the definition of marriage from between two adults to between a man and a woman. A discriminatory bill, which seeks to criminalize the promotion of LGBT+ rights in a similar fashion to Russia, is making its way through parliament.</section>
<section>Safe spaces are vitally important for communities such as ours and that is why NGO Kyrgyz Indigo is raising funds for a “Rainbow House” (watch the video here). This community centre will offer:
<ul>
  <li>a safe haven where excluded, abandoned or terrorized LGBT+ persons can find shelter;</li>
  <li>a creative space where LGBT+ people can collaborate and fulfill their potential;</li>
  <li>a learning environment where we can empower each other;</li>
  <li>a secluded area for LGBT+ people to socialize without fear of being forcefully outed;</li>
<li>a secure base, financially sustainable, for us to continue helping LGBT+
Our desire to establish the Rainbow House comes not just in the face of the challenges mentioned above but also with the aim of making our society more inclusive and diverse, and foster a commitment to human rights and equal opportunities.</li></ul></section>

 
 <section>
What we need & what you will get
Creating and equipping the Rainbow House with all it needs to accommodate LGBT+ people in need and to enable us to continue standing up for their rights is expensive and resource consuming. We estimate the total cost to be around $100,000, of which so far we’ve raised $52,000.</section>
      <section>
Every dollar donated by you will move us closer to our main goal of creating a space where gay, lesbian, bisexual, intersex and transgender persons, as well as their allies and families, can freely express their sexual orientations and gender identities. It will be a space where diversity, equality, mutual understanding, respect and positive recognition are embraced, something crucial for the spiritual, intellectual and physical development of us all.</section>
      <section>
By donating to our cause you will be contributing tremendously to LGBT+ activism not only in Kyrgyzstan but also in Central Asia, as whilst the situation is difficult in our country, in the four other countries in Central Asia the situation is worse. For many, Kyrgyzstan is a refuge and the Rainbow House could be invaluable for their safety and wellbeing. You will also be actively playing a part in creating an inclusive country with equal rights for all.</section>
      <section>
Once the Rainbow House has been established, you are invited to visit our beautiful home, giving you the opportunity to witness a part of the world you might not have explored before. Alternatively, you could become a volunteer for Kyrgyz Indigo, helping promote equal rights in Kyrgyzstan.</section>
      <section>
This campaign is part of a series of ongoing fundraisers. If we raise just $7,000 more, the Rainbow House will become a reality! We know that Kyrgyz Indigo’s Rainbow House will be key to empowering the LGBT+ community to stand up for their rights and help transform Kyrgyzstan into a country that values diversity, respects human rights and appreciates the rule of law.
Thank you for your support!</section>
